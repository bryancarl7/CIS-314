# C/Assembly
This repository is mainly low-level C programming and some X86-64 and Y86-64. All Run on Arch Linux using virtual box

# Running them 
You can compile them on any online C compiler, but if you want 100% replicable results, run on Arch Linux using the gcc compiler command with the -o flag. The first variable filename.c will be the pre-compiled C file, and the second variable newfilename will be the executable. Then call the executable by typing ./<newfilename command. 

1) gcc -o filename.c newfilename

2) ./newfilename
